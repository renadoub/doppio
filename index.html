				<div class="focuslineright">	
					<p>The Doppio Systematic Currency Fund is a relative value currency hedge fund <u>PROJECT</u>.</p>
					<p>The Fund run an active and adaptive strategy with the objective to generate a high and consistent long-term absolute risk-adjusted return.</p>
					<p>The Fund mainly invests in ten of the most liquid currencies in the world: Australian dollar, British Pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, Japanese yen, Norwegian krona, New Zealand dollar, Swedish krona, Swiss Franc and United States dollar.</p>
					<p>A proprietary model is used to forecast short term expected return on those currencies and the results are used in a portfolio optimizations model to maximize the Funds expected return subject to various risk limits. The resulting portfolio has no net exposure to the US Dollar. We believe this would ensure a high return/risk ratio.</p>
					<p>Due to this nature of the Fund, the Fund has <u>very low correlation</u> to traditional asset classes such as Equities and Bonds over time.</p>
