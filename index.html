    <h2 class="section">ABSOLUTE RETURN CURRENCY HEDGE FUND</h2>

    <p>The Doppio Systematic Currency Fund is an absolute return currency hedge fund <u>PROJECT</u>.</p>

    <p>The Fund run an active and adaptive strategy with the objective to generate a high and consistent long-term absolute risk-adjusted return.</p>
    <p>The Fund mainly invests in ten of the most liquid currencies in the world: Australian dollar, British Pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, Japanese yen, Norwegian krona, New Zealand dollar, Swedish krona, Swiss Franc and United States dollar.</p>
    <p>A proprietary model is used to forecast short term expected return on those currencies and the results are used in a portfolio optimizations model to maximize the Funds expected return subject to various risk limits. The resulting portfolio has no net exposure to the US Dollar. We believe this would ensure a high return/risk ratio.</p>
    <p>Due to this nature of the Fund, the Fund has <u>very low correlation</u> to traditional asset classes such as Equities and Bonds over time.</p>

    <h2 class="section">INVESTMENT APPROACH</h2>
    <div class="row">
            <div class="ccol-md-8">
              <h2>Guiding principles</h2>
              <p><u>The currency markets are the most liquid in the world (with a daily turnover greater than USD 2 trillion) but are not efficient</u></p>
              <p>Economists would define an efficient market as "a market where prices reflect all available information and so traders and investors should not be able to earn excess retrun over time". With those asumptions the uncovered interest rate parity should hold and in other words carry trades should not make money consistently over time. Similarly trend-following strategies should not be profitable.</p>
              <p>Behavioural economics provides some explanations for market observed dynamics. In essence they are based on a world where market participants have different beliefs of what drive currency markets, different objectives that they may be maximising and often have different information at variou times. In such a world investors can earn systematic returns over time, but not without taking risks, and there is room for "smart" investors to outperform "average" investor.

              <p><u>Alpha lies where interests from the currency market participants diverge</u></p>
              <p>The currency market is segmented between profit-seekers (ex: hedge funds) and liquidity-seekers (ex: corporates). Liquidity-seekers are willing to pay a premium to induce profit-seekers into currency markets. As a result, this segmentation would lead profit-seekers generally making profit over time, while liquidity-seekers would not as they pursue a different objective. Different analyses (Deutsche Bank, BIS survey) show that profit-seekers account for at most 50% of the whole currency market which leaves plenty of room for generating alpha.</p>
              <p>The hypothesis that profit-seekers consistently make profit at the expense of liquidity-seekers is verified in practice. The CFTC publishes weekly data on the futures positions of two self-defined groups on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME): non-commercial traders and commercial traders. The former trade for speculative purposes (profit-seekers), while the latter for hedging purposes (liquidity-seekers). It appears that for every year over the last 25 liquidity-seekers systematically loose money.</p>

              <p><u>Currency market profit-seekers are copy-cats</u></p>
              <p>The most popular trading strategies used by active currency managers are carry, value, momentum, and volatility. A carry strategy consists in borrowing in a low interest rate currency and invest in a high interest rate currency. A value strategy consists in selling overvalued currencies and buying undervalued currencies where the value is derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) theory. A momentum stategy is a classic trend-following strategy. A volatility strategy consists in investing in the currency option market to to either take a directional view on volatility, express a view on risk-aversion and event risks.</p>
              <p>These four strategies have been very popular in the past 25 years with cyclical results. Lacklusters returns have become a familiar tale for investors in those strategies as classic models are failling in recent years.

              <h2>The Doppio innovative approach</h2>
              <p> Doppio offers to approach currency investment with a different persperctive, using infomation embedded in the currency volatility market to predict moves on its underlying currencies. Analysing the entire volatility surface provides valuable information about embedded risks and positioning that we can exploit to generate a dynamic unbiased and diversified portfolio. This portfolio is rebalanced daily and should perform in any market environment.</p>

              <p><u>An innovative approach to Carry</u></p>
              <p>When global uncertainty decreases, implied volatilities tend to go lower. This environment is known to be profitable for carry strategies. On the contrary, when global uncertainty increase, so does implied volatilities and carry strategies tend to underperform.</p>

              <p><b>graph DB Carry vs CVIX
              caption: Deutsche Bank G10 carry Index (DB Carry) vs Deutshe Bank Currency Volatility Index (CVIX). The DB Carry index underperforms when the CVIX rises.</p></b>

              <p>However, the implied volatility of higher yielding currencies (higher interest rate) tends to increase (resp. decrease) in proportion more than those of lower yielding currencies when global uncertainty rises (resp. declines).</p>
              <p><i>By investing in currencies that have decreasing implied volatilities compared to its peers and selling those that have an increasing volatility, we generate a dynamic carry strategy that adapts rapidly to changing environments.</i></p>


              <p><u>An innovative approach to Momentum</u></p>
              <p>When a currency trends it's realised volatility diminished.</p>

              <p><b>graph CCY vs STDDEV
              caption: Levels of the Australian Dollar (AUD/USD) vs realised volatility expressed by it's rolling standard deviation (90 days). When the currency trends, the realised volatility decreases.</p></b>

              <p>In the options market this is expressed through a repricing of the implied volatilities for this currency as option market participants will no longer benefit by being long the option and dynamically hedging (as the Profit and Loss of such investment is a function of realised volatility).</p>
              <p><i>By investing in a currencies whose implied volatility experienced a recent significative drop relative to their peers, we generate a dynamic momentum strategy that captures rapidly sustainable trends.</i></p>

              <p><u>An innovative approach to Valuation</u></p>
              <p>When a currency is reaching key levels in terms of valuations, market participants will prepare for this trend to reverse.

              <p><b>graph CFTC positioning vs PPP valuation
              caption: CFTC positioning (published with a lag of 7 days) vs the Australian Dollar (AUD/USD) valuation measures using the Purchasing Power Parity model. The positioning shows an increase in bullish/bearish views when the Australian Dollar is reaching high/low levels (above 2 standard deviation around it's long term average).</p></b>

              <p>Through the options markets this is express by a shift in interest into Call and Puts. For example when a currency is reaching new lows and market participants believe that the currency should not go much lower, the value of Puts at lower strikes will decrease as interest will fade. Consequently the implied volatilities of "out of the money" Puts will decrease compare to out of the money call (as prices are an increasing function of implied volatilities). Hence this change in market sentiment can be captured by analysing risk reversals (Price of an Out of the money call - Price of an out of the money Put).</p>
              <p><i>By investing in currencies that experience a recent increase in risk reversals and selling currencies that experience a recent drop in risk reversals, we generate a dynamic valuation strategy that capture in time reversion of trends.<i></p>

              <p><u>An innovative approach to Volatility</u></p>
              <p>The Doppio approach relies solely on the analyses if the Volatility surfaces of the vested currencies. It does not invest in the options market and hence doesn't take directional views on volatility. However, by construction in low volatility environments it favours high volatile currencies (measured as long term averages) and reciprocally in high volatile environments it favours currencies low volatile currencies. As such the portfolio should remain protected when global uncertainty rises and should become more exposed when global uncertainty diminishes.</p>


              <p><i>By investing in currencies using their level of implied volatilities as signal, we are able to generate a portfolio that adjusts dynamicaly to market environments and provide a consisted level of risk to investors.<i></p>

              <p><u>Comparing to Bonds and Equities</u></p>
              <p>The Doppio approach should have by construction no long term bias to any of the currencies it invests in. The comparison shows that returns when adjusted for risk (ie the Sharpe ratio) is higher for the Doppio strategy than in either bonds or equities. Additionaly the strategy has a very low correlation to bonds and equities.</p>

              <p><i>The Doppio strategy scores on both counts of positive expected returns and diversification.<i></p>
